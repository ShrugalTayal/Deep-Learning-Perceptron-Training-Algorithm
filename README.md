# Deep-Learning-Perceptron-Training-Algorithm
Implement a Perceptron Training Algorithm from Scratch


PTA updates weights when a mistake is made.
The code calculate number of weight updates necessary for convergence for the following operations using:

(1). Two variables:  AND

(2). Two variables: OR

(3). One variable: NOT


The code draws the decision boundary at each step of learning for all 3 operations (AND, OR, and NOT).
